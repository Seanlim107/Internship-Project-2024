<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The following GitHub repository highlights the work done by me (Sean Lim) during my internship-dissertation program at City, University of London under the company AITIS (AITI Solutions).

In this project, I attempt to improve on the current state of object to object distance estimation by introducing OriDim, a model that estimates an object's dimensions and orientation through input cropped images of various objects detected by an object detection algorithm (YOLO, for example).

The dataset used is a custom dataset provided by AITIS concerning objects in a Construction Site (workers, pump trucks, cranes, forklifts etc.) but is not provided in this repository due to privacy and sensitivity issues. Instead, I have included images taken from a high rise building with similar objects in a Construction Site to showcase the performance of my model.</p>
